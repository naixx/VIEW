This fork intened to make VIEW intervalometer to be more stable, predictable in ramping, alghoritms  and eliminate bugfixes. I can only support sony cameras since I'm able to test it only Sony A6300 and A6600.
For now I understand in general how VIEW works, what algorithm is used and why it can go extremely dark or light. As for now I see that estimated ramping should be different, histogram and luminance is incorrect, hightlights protection calculations can produce underexposure so it is better to turn it off. Further investigations required. 

Releases provided AS IS. I've already soft bricked my VIEW during development and some nervous nights spent to restore it. Provided releases where tested to run on my view. Just download archieve on sdcard and install update via `Firmware Update` menu. If anything goes wrong, refer to troubleshooting in official docs to rollback to other versions.

Feel free to contact me to discuss ideas, VIEW development and further enhancements.
